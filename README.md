_IN PROGRESS_

[![travis build](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS)
[![lgtm code quality](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/javascript/g/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS.svg?style=flat-square&label=code-quality)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/)

In progress three.js implementation of the [3D Tiles format](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/blob/master/specification/).

The renderer supports a limited subset of the spec for the moment. See [Issue #15](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/issues/15) for information on which features are not yet implemented.

See it in action [here](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/3DTilesRendererJS/example/bundle/)!

**In Progress Features**
- Multicamera support
- Travis integration
- Performance

# Use

```js
import { TilesRenderer } from '3d-tiles-renderer';

// ... initialize three scene ...

const tilesRenderer = new TilesRenderer( './path/to/tileset.json' );
tilesRenderer.setCamera( camera );
tilesRenderer.setResolutionFromRenderer( camera, renderer );
scene.add( tilesRenderer.group );

renderLoop();

function renderLoop() {

	requestAnimationFrame( renderLoop );

	// The camera matrix is expected to be up to date
	// before calling tilesRenderer.update
	camera.updateMatrixWorld();
	tilesRenderer.update();
	renderer.render( camera, scene );

}


```

# API

## TilesRenderer

_extends [TilesRendererBase](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/blob/master/src/base/TilesRendererBase.js), which can be used to implement a 3d tiles renderer in other engines_

### .errorTarget

```js
errorTarget = 6 : Number
```

The target screenspace error in pixels to target when updating the geometry. Tiles will not render if they have below this level of screenspace error.

### .errorThreshold

```js
errorThreshold = Infinity : Number
```

Value used to compute the threshold `errorTarget * errorThreshold` above which tiles will not render. This is used to enable traversal to skip loading and rendering parent tiles far from the cameras current screenspace error requirement.

If `errorThreshold` is set to `Infinity` then all parent tiles will be loaded and rendered. If it's set to `0` then no parent tiles will render and only the tiles that are being rendered will be loaded.

### .maxDepth

```js
maxDepth = Infinity : Number
```

The max depth to which tiles will be loaded and rendered.

### .loadSiblings

```js
loadSiblings = true : Boolean
```

If true then all sibling tiles will be loaded, as well, to ensure coherence when moving the camera. If false then only currently viewed tiles will be loaded.

### .lruCache

```js
lruCache = new LRUCache() : LRUCache
```

_NOTE: This cannot be set once [update](#update) is called for the first time._

### .downloadQueue

```js
downloadQueue = new PriorityQueue : PriorityQueue
```

_NOTE: This cannot be set once [update](#update) is called for the first time._

### .parseQueue

```js
parseQueue = new PriorityQueue : PriorityQueue
```

_NOTE: This cannot be modified once [update](#update) is called for the first time._


### .group

```js
group : Group
```

The container group for the 3d tiles. Add this to the three.js scene in order to render it.

### .constructor

```js
constructor( url : String )
```

Takes the url of the `tileset.json` for the tileset to be rendered.

### .update

```js
update() : void
```

Updates the tiles to render and kicks off loads for the appropriate tiles in the 3d tile set.

### .getBounds

```js
getBounds( box : Box3 ) : boolean
```

Sets `box` to the root bounding box of the tileset in the [group](#group) frame. Returns `false` if the tile root was not loaded.

### .raycast

```js
raycast( raycaster : Raycaster, intersects : Array ) : void
```

### .hasCamera

```js
hasCamera( camera : Camera ) : boolean
```

Returns `true` if the camera has already been set on the renderer.

### .setCamera

```js
setCamera( camera : Camera ) : boolean
```

Adds the camera to the camera to be accounted for when traversing the tileset. Returns `false` if the camera is already being tracked. Returns `true` otherwise.

### .deleteCamera

```js
deleteCamera( camera : Camera ) : boolean
```

Removes the given camera from being accounted for when traversing the tileset. Returns `false` if the camera was not tracked.

### .setResolution

```js
setResolution( camera : Camera, resolution : Vector2 ) : boolean
setResolution( camera : Camera, x : number, y : number ) : boolean
```

Sets the resolution being rendered to for the given camera. Returns `false` if the camera is not being tracked.

### .setResolutionFromRenderer

```js
setResolutionFromRenderer( camera : Camera, renderer : WebGLRenderer ) : boolean
```

Sets the resolution being rendered to for the given camera via renderer which accounts for canvas size and current pixel ratio. Returns `false` if the camera is not being tracked.

## PriorityQueue

Piority-sorted queue to prioritize file downloads and parsing.

### .maxJobs

```js
maxJobs = 6 : number
```

The maximum number of jobs to be processing at once.

## LRUCache

Utility class for the TilesRenderer to keep track of currently used items so rendered items will not be unloaded.

### .maxSize

```js
maxSize = 800 : number
```

The maximum cached size. If that current amount of cached items is equal to this value then no more items can be cached.

### .minSize

```js
minSize = 600 : number
```

The minimum cache size. Above this cached data will be unloaded if it's unused.

### .unloadPercent

```js
unloadPercent = 0.05 : number
```

The maximum percentage of [minSize](#minSize) to unload during a given frame.
