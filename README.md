_IN PROGRESS_

[![travis build](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS)
[![lgtm code quality](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/javascript/g/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS.svg?style=flat-square&label=code-quality)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/)

In progress three.js implementation of the [3D Tiles format](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/blob/master/specification/).

The renderer supports a limited subset of the spec for the moment. See [Issue #15](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/issues/15) for information on which features are not yet implemented.

See it in action [here](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/3DTilesRendererJS/example/bundle/)!

**In Progress Features**
- Multicamera support
- Travis integration
- Performance

# Use

```js
import { TilesRenderer } from '3d-tiles-renderer';

// ... initialize three scene ...

const tilesRenderer = new TilesRenderer( './path/to/tileset.json' );
tilesRenderer.setCamera( camera );
tilesRenderer.setResolutionFromRenderer( camera, renderer );
scene.add( tilesRenderer.group );

renderLoop();

function renderLoop() {

	requestAnimationFrame( renderLoop );

	// The camera matrix is expected to be up to date
	// before calling tilesRenderer.update
	camera.updateMatrixWorld();
	tilesRenderer.update();
	renderer.render( camera, scene );

}


```

# API

## TilesRenderer

### .errorTarget

```js
errorTarget = 6 : Number
```

The target screenspace error in pixels to target when updating the geometry. Tiles will not render if they have below this level of screenspace error.

### .errorThreshold

```js
errorThreshold = Infinity : Number
```

Value used to compute the threshold `errorTarget * errorThreshold` above which tiles will not render. This is used to enable traversal to skip loading and rendering parent tiles far from the cameras current screenspace error requirement.

If `errorThreshold` is set to `Infinity` then all parent tiles will be loaded and rendered. If it's set to `0` then no parent tiles will render and only the tiles that are being rendered will be loaded.

### .maxDepth

```js
maxDepth = Infinity : Number
```

The max depth to which tiles will be loaded and rendered.

### .loadSiblings

```js
loadSiblings = true : Boolean
```

If true then all sibling tiles will be loaded, as well, to ensure coherence when moving the camera. If false then only currently viewed tiles will be loaded.

### .lruCache

```js
lruCache = new LRUCache() : LRUCache
```

_NOTE: This cannot be set once [update](#update) is called for the first time._

### .downloadQueue

```js
downloadQueue = new PriorityQueue : PriorityQueue
```

_NOTE: This cannot be set once [update](#update) is called for the first time._

### .parseQueue

```js
parseQueue = new PriorityQueue : PriorityQueue
```

_NOTE: This cannot be modified once [update](#update) is called for the first time._


### .group

```js
group : Group
```

The container group for the 3d tiles. Add this to the three.js scene in order to render it.

### .constructor

```js
constructor( url : String )
```

### .update

```js
update() : void
```

### .getBounds

```js
getBounds( box : Box3 ) : void
```

### .raycast

```js
raycast( raycaster : Raycaster, intersects : Array ) : void
```

### .hasCamera

```js
hasCamera( camera : Camera ) : boolean
```

### .setCamera

```js
setCamera( camera : Camera ) : boolean
```

### .deleteCamera

```js
deleteCamera( camera : Camera ) : boolean
```

### .setResolution

```js
setResolution( camera : Camera, resolution : Vector2 ) : boolean
setResolution( camera : Camera, x : number, y : number ) : boolean
```

### .setResolutionFromRenderer

```js
setResolutionFromRenderer( camera : Camera, renderer : WebGLRenderer ) : boolean
```
